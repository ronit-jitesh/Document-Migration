QUALITY INSPECTION - Final Product Check
(this replaces the old QI-100 form, I think?)

Version 4.1 or maybe 4.2, check with Lisa in Document Control

Applicable to: All finished goods leaving Building 12
Responsible: QC Inspectors (Tier 2 certified minimum)
Date: August 2022 (overdue for review!!)

FIRST THINGS FIRST - SAFETY:
Don't handle products without clean gloves (lint-free, nitrile).
Some products contain beryllium copper alloy - TOXIC if dust is generated.
If you see any dust or powder, STOP IMMEDIATELY, evacuate area, call EHS at ext. 4455.
Wear lab coat to prevent contamination of product surfaces.

INSPECTION PROCEDURE:

A. Visual Inspection (do this first obviously)
   - Check product against reference sample (golden sample in cabinet A-3)
   - Look for: scratches, dents, discoloration, foreign particles
   - Cosmetic defects classified per DIN EN ISO 8785:
     * Class A surface: ZERO defects allowed
     * Class B surface: max 2 minor defects per unit
     * Class C surface: max 5 minor defects per unit
   - USE THE MICROSCOPE for Class A surfaces (40x minimum)
   
B. Dimensional Check
   - Measure critical dimensions per drawing (latest revision ONLY - check PLM system)
   - Use calibrated instruments: calipers (±0.01mm), micrometers, CMM for complex geometries
   - Record all measurements on Form QC-200 (digital version preferred)
   - Out-of-tolerance = immediate HOLD tag + notify production supervisor
   
C. Functional Testing (if applicable)
   - Refer to product-specific test procedure (see test matrix TM-500)
   - Electrical products: hi-pot test at 1500V AC for 60 seconds (WEAR INSULATED GLOVES)
   - Mechanical products: torque test, load test per spec
   - WARNING: some functional tests involve HIGH PRESSURE pneumatics.
     Stay behind blast shield. Verify pressure relief valve is operational BEFORE test.

D. Documentation & Packaging
   - Complete inspection report in SAP QM module
   - Apply QC PASSED sticker (green) or QC REJECTED sticker (red)
   - Passed units: pack per packaging spec PS-300
   - Rejected units: segregate in red-tag area, initiate NCR (non-conformance report)

EQUIPMENT LIST (scattered around the lab, good luck finding everything):
- Calibrated calipers
- Micrometer set (0-25mm, 25-50mm, 50-75mm)
- CMM machine (Zeiss Contura - book time slots in advance!)
- Stereo microscope
- Hi-pot tester
- Insulated gloves (class 0, tested within 6 months)
- Force/torque gauge
- Golden reference samples
- Surface roughness tester (Ra measurement)

ADDITIONAL SAFETY NOTES I FORGOT TO PUT AT THE TOP:
- Fire extinguisher location: next to exit door B-12
- First aid kit: wall-mounted, station 3
- Emergency shower: hallway near stairwell C
- If hi-pot test triggers arc flash, DO NOT re-test. Equipment must be inspected by electrical safety team.

Common issues we keep seeing (for reference):
1. People using expired calibration instruments - CHECK THE STICKER DATE
2. Wrong drawing revision pulled from PLM - always verify rev letter matches work order  
3. QC stickers running out - order from stores, part number STK-QC-G and STK-QC-R
4. SAP QM crashing mid-report - save frequently, IT ticket #45892 still open
