motor assembly procedure
ver. 0.9 DRAFT - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION
last updated sometime in Q2 2023

Written by: K. Schmidt / Floor 7 Assembly Team

CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION
High voltage components present. DE-ENERGIZE before working.
Lock-out/Tag-out (LOTO) procedure MUST be followed. See EHS-LOTO-001.
Failure to comply = immediate work stoppage + incident report.

Tools Required:
torque wrench (calibrated!!! check sticker), bearing press, alignment jig model AJ-400,
digital multimeter, thermal paste (Arctic MX-6 or approved equivalent), 
safety gloves (cut-resistant, rated CR5), steel-toe boots required in assembly area

PPE REQUIREMENTS:
- Hard hat in designated zones
- Safety glasses at ALL times
- Hearing protection when press is operating (>85dB)
- Cut-resistant gloves for handling stator laminations (edges are razor sharp!)

step 1. Receive motor housing from warehouse. check PO number matches work order.
        Inspect housing for shipping damage - dents, scratches, corrosion
        
step 2. Install stator assembly into housing
       - Use bearing press. MAX FORCE: 2.5 kN. DO NOT EXCEED.
       - Alignment must be within 0.02mm tolerance (use dial indicator)
       - If misaligned, DO NOT force. Return to supervisor.

step 3. Route stator windings through terminal block
        DANGER: even though power is off, residual charge may be present.
        Use multimeter to verify 0V before touching any leads.

step 4. Install rotor assembly
        - Apply thermal paste to bearing seats (thin, even layer)
        - Insert rotor, rotate by hand to verify free spinning
        - Acceptable drag: < 0.1 Nm at room temperature

step 5. Attach end bells / bearing caps
        - Torque bolts to 12 Nm in STAR PATTERN (not sequential!)
        - Use calibrated torque wrench ONLY
        - Document torque values on traveler sheet

step 6. Connect power leads to terminal box
        - Follow wiring diagram rev. C (posted at station 7B)
        - Double-check phase rotation: U-V-W sequence

step 7. Run initial test
        - Megger test: insulation resistance > 100 MΩ at 500V DC
        - No-load run: 5 minutes, check for abnormal vibration or noise
        - Record current draw on test sheet
        
NOTE FROM KARL: the alignment jig on station 4 is broken again. 
Use the one from station 6 but make sure to return it.

Random additional notes:
- Shift handover: document incomplete assemblies in logbook
- If motor fails test, tag as "HOLD" with red tag and notify QC team
- Scrap rate target: < 2% per month

Environmental: dispose of used thermal paste as hazardous waste (bin C-yellow)
