*** IMPORTANT: Always wear safety goggles! Do NOT skip this! ***

ok so basically the soldering process goes like this:

1) first make sure the soldering station is turned on and heated to 350°C
WARNING: the tip gets really hot, like REALLY hot. burns are common if you're not careful!!!

2) check the PCB for any visible defects before you begin. look for cracks, 
   missing pads, stuff like that.

SAFETY NOTE - Lead-free solder is preferred. If using leaded solder (Sn63/Pb37), 
ensure fume extraction is ON and wear a respirator mask. This is MANDATORY per 
EHS regulation 4.2.1.

3) apply flux to the joint area. dont use too much, just a thin layer
4) Place component on the board and hold steady
5) Touch the soldering iron tip to BOTH the pad and component lead simultaneously
6) Feed solder wire into the joint - should take about 2-3 seconds per joint
7) Remove iron and let joint cool naturally. DO NOT BLOW ON IT!

Equipment you'll need (probably):
- Soldering station (Weller WX1 or equivalent) 
- Solder wire 0.5mm dia
- Flux pen
- PCB holder/vise
- ESD wrist strap (!! connect to ground point !!)
- Magnifying lamp
- Isopropyl alcohol + brush for cleaning

oh also: make sure you're wearing an ESD wrist strap at all times when handling 
the boards. Static discharge can destroy components instantly. This has happened 
before on Floor 3B, see incident report IR-2023-0847.

QUALITY CHECK (supposed to be a separate doc but whatever):
- Inspect each joint with magnifying glass
- Good joint = shiny, concave fillet
- Bad joint = dull, blobby, or cold joint
- Rework bad joints within same shift

Clean board with IPA after all joints are complete.
